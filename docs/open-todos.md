# Open TODOs for LOCAL-LLM-STACK-RELOADED

This document compiles all started but not completed and open TODOs in the LOCAL-LLM-STACK-RELOADED project. It serves as a roadmap for future work and helps track progress on various aspects of the project.

## Security Improvements

### High Priority
- Replace remaining instances of `shell=True` with proper argument lists in:
  - `llm_stack/tools/knowledge_graph/generate_graph.py`
  - `llm_stack/code_quality/module.py`
- Implement proper input validation before passing to subprocess in all command execution functions
- Replace hardcoded default credentials in Neo4j client with secure credential management

### Medium Priority
- Implement secure credential management throughout the codebase
- Add security tests to verify security fixes

## Code Structure Improvements

### High Priority
- Standardize error handling across all modules:
  - Replace generic exceptions with specific exception types
  - Update all modules to use the standardized error classes from `llm_stack/core/error.py`
- Improve object-oriented design:
  - Refactor core modules to better utilize OOP principles
  - Replace global state with proper class structures in `llm_stack/core/config.py`

### Medium Priority
- Fix thread-safety issues:
  - Implement thread-safe singleton pattern in Neo4j client
- Implement proper interfaces for all components as mentioned in specification-manifest.md:
  - Document all interfaces
  - Ensure all components implement the appropriate interfaces

## Code Quality Improvements

### High Priority
- Translate all German comments and docstrings to English for consistency
- Reduce code duplication by extracting common functionality into shared utilities
- Fix string formatting in Cypher queries:
  - Replace f-string formatting with parameterized queries in `llm_stack/knowledge_graph/client.py`

### Medium Priority
- Address global state and hardcoded values:
  - Replace hardcoded values with configuration parameters
- Implement validation for all configuration:
  - Validate all configuration
  - Provide defaults for missing configuration

## Performance Optimizations

### Medium Priority
- Optimize file operations in core modules:
  - Improve file handling in `llm_stack/core/config.py` and other files
- Optimize database operations:
  - Improve database query performance in knowledge graph modules

## Testing Improvements

### High Priority
- Increase unit test coverage for core functionality
- Add integration tests for component interactions

### Medium Priority
- Add performance tests to verify performance optimizations
- Implement comprehensive tests for all utility functions

## Documentation Improvements

### Medium Priority
- Complete documentation for all interfaces
- Expand the documentation and examples to cover more use cases
- Create comprehensive documentation for all utility modules

## Knowledge Graph Enhancements

### Medium Priority
- Implement additional query capabilities for the knowledge graph
- Enhance visualization capabilities for the knowledge graph
- Improve integration between the knowledge graph and code quality tools

## Module and Tool Integration

### Medium Priority
- Complete implementation of the Module API as defined in `module_api.py`:
  - Ensure all modules implement the `initialize()` method
- Complete implementation of the Tool API:
  - Ensure all tools implement the `initialize()` method

## Design Pattern Implementation

### Low Priority
- Implement Singleton pattern for module instances:
  - Use module-level instances
  - Implement getter functions for access
- Implement Factory pattern for creating objects:
  - Use factory functions
  - Integrate with dependency injection
- Implement Strategy pattern for interchangeable algorithms:
  - Use interfaces
  - Enhance extensibility

## Future Work from Code Quality Review

### Medium Priority
- Identify additional patterns of redundancy that could be extracted into shared utilities
- Refactor existing code to use the shared utilities
- Add comprehensive tests for all utility functions
- Expand the documentation and examples to cover more use cases

## Partially Implemented Features

### High Priority
- Complete the code quality module implementation:
  - Finish integration with knowledge graph for tracking code transformations
  - Complete the user-friendly CLI for code quality improvements
- Complete the architecture analysis integration with code quality review:
  - Implement remaining phases of the code quality assessment framework
  - Complete component-level analysis
  - Complete code-level analysis
  - Finish migration quality analysis

## Dependencies and Integration

### Medium Priority
- Implement explicit dependencies in component interfaces
- Provide default implementations for backward compatibility
- Implement lazy initialization to avoid circular dependencies

## Timeline and Tracking

The implementation timeline as outlined in the code quality implementation plan:

- Phase 1 (Security Fixes): 2025-04-07 to 2025-04-09
- Phase 2 (Structural Improvements): 2025-04-10 to 2025-04-14
- Phase 3 (Code Quality Improvements): 2025-04-15 to 2025-04-21
- Phase 4 (Performance Optimizations): 2025-04-22 to 2025-04-24
- Phase 5 (Testing Improvements): 2025-04-25 to 2025-04-29
