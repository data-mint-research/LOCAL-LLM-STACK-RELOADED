# API Documentation

This documentation provides comprehensive information about the APIs, components, and utilities in the LOCAL-LLM-STACK-RELOADED project. It is designed to help developers understand the system architecture, use the available APIs effectively, and contribute to the project.

## Overview

The LOCAL-LLM-STACK-RELOADED project is a Python-based implementation of a local LLM (Large Language Model) stack that provides integration with various components such as Ollama, LibreChat, and Neo4j. The project is organized into modules, each with its own set of APIs and utilities.

## Core Components

### [Core Utilities](./core/index.md)

The core utilities provide essential functionality for configuration management, Docker operations, validation, logging, and more. These utilities are used throughout the project to ensure consistent behavior and reduce code duplication.

Key features:
- Configuration management with environment variables
- Docker and Docker Compose operations
- Validation utilities for configuration values, files, and directories
- Consistent logging throughout the application
- Command execution and output handling
- File operations and parsing
- System utilities for interacting with the operating system
- Error handling and dependency injection

### [Configuration Management](./core/config.md)

The configuration management module provides functions for loading, validating, and managing the configuration for the LOCAL-LLM-STACK-RELOADED project. It includes functionality for loading and saving configuration from .env files, validating configuration values, generating and managing secure secrets, and creating backups of configuration files.

## Modules

### [Knowledge Graph](./knowledge_graph/index.md)

The Knowledge Graph module provides integration with Neo4j for the LOCAL-LLM-STACK-RELOADED project, serving as a central knowledge base for autonomous AI Coding Agents. It enables the capture, storage, and querying of information about the migration process from Bash to Python, tracking migration decisions, code transformations, and the relationships between original Bash files and their Python equivalents.

Key features:
- Neo4j database integration
- Schema management
- Migration tracking
- Code transformation recording
- File relationship management
- CLI commands for interacting with the Knowledge Graph

## Command-Line Interface

### [CLI Commands](./cli/index.md)

The LOCAL-LLM-STACK-RELOADED project provides a comprehensive command-line interface (CLI) for managing the stack, its components, and modules. The CLI is implemented in Python using the Click library and serves as a replacement for the original Bash-based CLI.

Key commands:
- Starting and stopping the stack and its components
- Managing models
- Configuring the stack
- Generating and managing secrets
- Interacting with the Knowledge Graph
- Running code quality checks

## Integration Points

The project provides several integration points for extending its functionality:

1. **Module Interface**: Implement the `ModuleInterface` class to create new modules that can be loaded and managed by the stack.
2. **Tool Interface**: Implement the `ToolInterface` class to create new tools that can be used by the stack.
3. **Dependency Injection**: Use the dependency injection framework to register and resolve dependencies.
4. **Configuration Extension**: Extend the configuration schema to add new configuration options.

## Best Practices

When working with the LOCAL-LLM-STACK-RELOADED project, follow these best practices:

1. **Use the configuration module**: Use the configuration module to load and validate configuration values instead of hardcoding them.
2. **Use the logging module**: Use the logging module for consistent logging throughout the application.
3. **Use the validation utilities**: Use the validation utilities to validate configuration values, files, and directories.
4. **Use the Docker operations module**: Use the Docker operations module for interacting with Docker and Docker Compose.
5. **Use the dependency injection framework**: Use the dependency injection framework to manage dependencies and improve testability.
6. **Handle errors consistently**: Use the error handling module to handle errors consistently throughout the application.
7. **Document your code**: Follow the documentation style guide to ensure consistent documentation throughout the project.
8. **Write tests**: Write unit and integration tests for your code to ensure it works as expected.

## Contributing

When contributing to the LOCAL-LLM-STACK-RELOADED project, please follow these guidelines:
